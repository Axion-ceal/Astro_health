# 🌌 AstroHealth AI  
### *AI-Powered Astronaut Health Monitoring System* 🚀  

> 🧠 An intelligent, space-themed web app that monitors astronaut vitals, predicts health risks, and offers personalized suggestions — built in just 24 hours for the NASA Space Hackathon 2025.

## 🪐 Inspiration

Astronauts on long-duration missions face physiological and psychological challenges — from increased heart rate to stress and temperature fluctuations in microgravity.  
We wanted to build a **simple AI-assisted system** that can track key vitals and provide **real-time insights and advice**, ensuring crew safety and mission continuity.

## 🚀 What It Does

**AstroHealth AI** is a web-based health monitor that:

- 🧭 Collects health parameters (Heart Rate, Blood Pressure, Stress, Temperature)  
- ⚙️ Analyzes health condition instantly using a Flask backend  
- 🧩 Saves logs to Firebase Firestore with timestamps  
- 💬 Generates smart suggestions for each abnormal vital  
- 📜 Displays previous health reports in a glowing space-themed dashboard  
- 🌠 Runs inside a Docker container for universal deployment
